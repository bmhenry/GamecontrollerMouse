Takes a gamecontroller's actions to control a computer mouse on screen.
Should allow normal mouse activities with other software mice & your
attached USB hardware mouse.


Left analog stick controls cursor movement.
^ Cursor speed scales with stick position, and moves far slower in the inner half of
the stick range than in the outer half (for your small button clicking pleasure)

Right analog stick controls horizontal and vertical scroll (only does one at a time).

Left bumper is left mouse button.
Right bumper is right mouse button.

DPad is *very* slow vertical and horizontal scroll, mostly for switching album pictures

X (left-most of the buttons on the right side of the controller)
will close the program at any time.



This was only tested with an XBox controller. It may work with others, but I haven't
tested it with one. It uses Win32 APIs heavily, and so will only work on Windows.


Absolutely no guarantees made, use at your own risk.
