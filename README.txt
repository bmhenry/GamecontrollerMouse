Takes a gamecontroller's actions to control a computer mouse on screen.
Should allow normal mouse activities with other software mice & your
attached USB hardware mouse.


Left analog stick controls cursor movement.
Right analog stick controls horizontal and vertical scroll (only does one at a time).
Left bumper is left mouse button.
Right bumper is right mouse button.

X (left-most of the buttons on the right side of the controller)
will close the program at any time.


This was only tested with an XBox controller. It may work with others, but I haven't
tested it with one. It uses Win32 APIs heavily, and so will only work on Windows.


Absolutely no guarantees made, use at your own risk.
